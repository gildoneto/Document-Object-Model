## DOM vs JavaScript

The DOM and JavaScript are completely different. One way to think about it is that the DOM API gives us the bricks, and JavaScript is the concrete (or glue) that holds them all together.

Lets look an another example below.

Here, we've just got a button, with a 'click' event added to it. Don't worry about click events for now - we have an entire section in the course on events. For now, just concentrate on the differences between JavaScript and the DOM.

Lets look at this example:

The pink highlights are JavaScript. The white text is the DOM API.

Hope its starting to make sense.

Keep going and see you in the next lectures ;)
